# 8-Bit-Gambit

## Details

*8-Bit Gambit* is a 1-button game where you play chess, but with explosions, against a CPU. The objective is to use your
pieces and their attack patterns to destroy all opponent pieces before the CPU destroys all of your pieces.

This game was made for the [2023 1-Button Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/1-button-jam-2023). It was created using Unity
2021.3.24f1.

## Instructions

All you need to play this game is the **spacebar**. In the menus, tap **spacebar** to toggle between button options, and
hold **spacebar** for two seconds to select the highlighted option. The gameplay is turn-based and follows the following
procedure:

1. The player selects an attacker piece by tapping **spacebar**. The player can see the piece's health and attack
   pattern in the details panel to the right of the board.
2. Once the player has decided which piece they want to attack with, they hold **spacebar** for two seconds to confirm
   the selected piece.
3. The player then selects a target piece to launch the attack on by tapping **spacebar**. The player can see the
   piece's health in the details panel to the right of the board.
4. Once the player has decided which piece they want to attack, they hold **spacebar** for two seconds to confirm the
   selected piece, and the attack will launch.
5. The CPU will then take its turn similarly, and the game will continue until either:
   - The player has destroyed all CPU pieces (player wins), 
   - The CPU has destroyed all player pieces (player loses), or
   - Both the player and CPU have no pieces left (draw).
